4,Sequences,2,Sequences,,,https://github.com/CSSE120StartingCode/Sequences,kCZMydx1OfM,"<ul><li>There are three types of sequences that we will study in this course</li><li style='margin-left: 30px;'><b>Lists</b> - Collection of objects that can be addressed by the list name + an index (other languages call them arrays)</li><li style='margin-left: 30px;'><b>Tuples</b> - Similar to a List, but this collection of objects cannot be changed.  Tuples are immutable.</li><li style='margin-left: 30px;'><b>Strings</b> - A very specific collection of objects that holds characters.  String are very common in your code, but they are a collection just like a List or Tuple. Just like a List individual characters can be address by the name of the string + an index</li></ul>"
