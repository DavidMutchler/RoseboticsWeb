1,Introduction to Python,2,What is Software Engineering?,yes,Questions,https://github.com/CSSE120StartingCode/IntroductionToPython,7MA6Irm81Ow,"<ul><li>We'd love for you all to become Software Engineers, it's pretty great, but let's talk more about what that means.</li></ul>"
1,Introduction to Python,3,m1e Comments Strings and print,yes,Questions,https://github.com/CSSE120StartingCode/IntroductionToPython,5Kx4dWr5q_c,"<ul><li>You will download the starting code using Git and work in PyCharm, <a target='_blank' href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sB-CAunUbr8WZdkzgjOgXL9Z7kz6s5RAY-JBmSpdYiw/edit?usp=sharing'>as per these instructions</a></li><li>This video uses Eclipse with SVN, so somethings will look different.  Only worry about the code and not the tool differences.</li></ul>"
1,Introduction to Python,4,m2 Hello world,,,https://github.com/CSSE120StartingCode/IntroductionToPython,6kIz4DX6aNY,"<ul><li>Hello, World is a classic first programming exercise</li><li>If you would like you can begin reading this exercise now and work the TODOs or you can wait until class.</li><li>When you do a commit you will be using Git instead of SVN as discussed in the code comments.</li></ul>"
1,Introduction to Python,5,m3 SimpleTurtles,,,https://github.com/CSSE120StartingCode/IntroductionToPython,MJXcNOHjTek,"<ul><li>To start learning about writing code, we'll use the SimpleTurtle class to practice writing code that you can see on your screen</li><li>Learn the SimpleTurtle methods by pattern matching the example code.</li><li>Pattern matching is a great first step when learning to write you own code.  Later you'll be asked to make something fun (and maybe even cool or interesting) with Turtle graphics.</li></ul>"
1,Introduction to Python,6,m4e Loopy Turtles concept,,,https://github.com/CSSE120StartingCode/IntroductionToPython,FinjGWFfxpA,"<ul><li>Let's take at the code in m4e and discuss the concepts that you should be learning.</li></ul>"
2,Objects Functions and Methods,1,Your first program FUNCTIONS,,,https://github.com/CSSE120StartingCode/ObjectsFunctionsAndMethods,nDOIDJzXgdo,"<ul><li>Start this unit by making a fork of the starting code from <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/CSSE120StartingCode/ObjectsFunctionsAndMethods'>here</a> and setting up a PyCharm project</li><li>If you need a reminder for how to fork a project then create a project in PyCharm from your forked repo revisit <a target='_blank' href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sB-CAunUbr8WZdkzgjOgXL9Z7kz6s5RAY-JBmSpdYiw/edit#heading=h.46un8o425mzw'>this link</a></li><li>Note: This video refers to exercises that you will see in Session 2 (the video falsely claims that you will see them in Session 1).</li></ul>"
2,Objects Functions and Methods,2,Calling Functions,,,https://github.com/CSSE120StartingCode/ObjectsFunctionsAndMethods,5U88VjvTQac,"<ul><li>The preceding video explained how a program's flow of control changes when a function call occurs.</li><li>This video explains the flow of information that occurs during a function call.</li></ul>"
2,Objects Functions and Methods,3,Coding to a specification,,,https://github.com/CSSE120StartingCode/ObjectsFunctionsAndMethods,E3mve9qqr4s,"<ul><li>You will apply the ideas of this video in all subsequent exercises in this class (and beyond).</li></ul>"
2,Objects Functions and Methods,4,Object Oriented Programming,,,https://github.com/CSSE120StartingCode/ObjectsFunctionsAndMethods,bTOCQq3hnuc,"<ul><li>This video explains the concept of Object Oriented Programming, contrasting it with Procedural Programming.</li></ul>"
2,Objects Functions and Methods,5,UML Class Diagrams,,,https://github.com/CSSE120StartingCode/ObjectsFunctionsAndMethods,0Y-TbDbpzRs,"<ul><li>The previous video introduced the concept of Object Oriented Programming (OOP).</li><li>This video explains the programming constructs that embody OOP â€” classes, objects, instance variables and methods.</li></ul>"
2,Objects Functions and Methods,6,Using Objects,,,https://github.com/CSSE120StartingCode/ObjectsFunctionsAndMethods,JXvyqPNrJHU,"<ul><li>This video extends the concepts from the previous videos to show how a software developer uses objects to be more productive.</li></ul>"
