1,Table based navigation with a single Core Data entity,1,Overview and breaking the Master-Detail template,yes,Questions,https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16GOkjkN5fEzpAzDOF-gX-nvKv9vMy-NTkGysxXcUtxQ/edit?usp=sharing,ADHPbtQdiWI,"<ul><li>The goal for this unit is to make a MovieQuotes app that uses Core Data</li><li>In addition to learning about Core Data, which will be the later videos, we'll also show you UI skills for tables, dialogs, and navigation controllers.</li><li>We'll start by looking at Apple's Master-Detail template for Core Data (then break it!)</li></ul>"
1,Table based navigation with a single Core Data entity,2,Basic UITableView,yes,Questions,https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16GOkjkN5fEzpAzDOF-gX-nvKv9vMy-NTkGysxXcUtxQ/edit?usp=sharing,8uvoGJh1Uwg,"<ul><li>We'll create a 'Temp' view controller to connect a delegate and dataSource to a UITableView</li><li>Note that a UITableView is just a specialized view.  In this lesson we'll use a UITableView within a normal view controller.</li><li>A UITableViewController is a subclass of UIViewController that is specifically a view controller that has only a UITableView in it (NOT using that this time).</li><li>This is an awesome exercise, but notice the name says 'Temp' (what does that mean to you?)</li></ul>"
1,Table based navigation with a single Core Data entity,3,Reading MovieQuotes for table display,yes,Questions,https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16GOkjkN5fEzpAzDOF-gX-nvKv9vMy-NTkGysxXcUtxQ/edit?usp=sharing,OAV-YVLyxPA,"<ul><li>This time we won't delete any of our work. :)  We'll start making our <b>real</b> list of MovieQuotes.</li><li>We'll worry only about the R in C<b>R</b>UD this time.  Since we don't have <b>C</b> yet the list will be hard coded.</li><li>We'll also learn about different UITableViewCell styles that are built in.</li></ul>"
1,Table based navigation with a single Core Data entity,4,Creating a MovieQuote,yes,Questions,https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16GOkjkN5fEzpAzDOF-gX-nvKv9vMy-NTkGysxXcUtxQ/edit?usp=sharing,BjqPyUGcOGI,"<ul><li>In this lesson we'll add a button (a <b>+</b> symbol) that will launch a dialog to let us add a quote.</li><li>Dialog boxes are called UIAlertViews in iOS and, as of iOS 8, they are created with UIAlertControllers.</li><li>We'll make a UIAlertController with two text fields so we can add Movie Quotes.</li></ul>"
1,Table based navigation with a single Core Data entity,5,Empty Message when no rows are present,yes,Questions,https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16GOkjkN5fEzpAzDOF-gX-nvKv9vMy-NTkGysxXcUtxQ/edit?usp=sharing,Ze2c1qensCg,"<ul><li>Now I'm just causing trouble. :)  I like to see a message when there are no rows present.</li><li>I think this is a nice UI feature, but it will cause a special case issue (display 1 row even if there are none) that we'll have to deal with for the rest of the app.</li></ul>"
1,Table based navigation with a single Core Data entity,6,Deleting a MovieQuote,yes,Questions,https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16GOkjkN5fEzpAzDOF-gX-nvKv9vMy-NTkGysxXcUtxQ/edit?usp=sharing,4HaviVGAdII,"<ul><li>UITableView has a nice built-in editing feature that we'll use for deleting quotes.</li><li>As always the basics are easy and it's the details that take time.</li><li>We'll learn about the methods for canEditRowAtIndexPath and commitEditingStyle.</li></ul>"
1,Table based navigation with a single Core Data entity,7,MovieQuote Detail ViewController,yes,Questions,https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16GOkjkN5fEzpAzDOF-gX-nvKv9vMy-NTkGysxXcUtxQ/edit?usp=sharing,6kxuBiM-9kg,"<ul><li>Time to actually make use of being in a navigation controller.  We'll make our first ever segue into another view controller!</li><li>Many of the steps in this video we've done before (constraints, connections) so we'll try to move quickly, but it still takes time.</li><li>The truly new part is the segue in the Storyboard.  There are two basic types of segues:</li><li style='margin-left: 30px;'><b>Selection segue</b> - An automatic segue that is added directly to a button or UITableViewCell that fires when the element is clicked (no code required).  We'll use a <b>Selection</b> segue here and do a little work in the prepareForSegue method, just before the selection segue fires.</li><li style='margin-left: 30px;'><b>Manual segue</b> - A segue that can be used by calling the method performSegueWithIdentifier.  It is handy when you want control over when to show the next view controller</li><li>One goof in this video!!! I forgot to change the accessory type on the MovieQuoteCell prototype to have a Disclosure Indicator, see the slides for more info (around slide 68) (oops!)</li></ul>"
