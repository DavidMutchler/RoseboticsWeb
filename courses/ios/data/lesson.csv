We'll talk to both from the iOS client later in the unit.</li></ul>"

1,Endpoints iOS Client,3,Generating Client Code Step #2: GTL Client Library,yes,Questions,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_V6-Rs8DxRcbovUSTfrQOoaZZT73B40tkaByJyilVp4/edit?usp=sharing,93dtzwuhEjw,"<ul><li><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_V6-Rs8DxRcbovUSTfrQOoaZZT73B40tkaByJyilVp4/edit?usp=sharing'>Generation client code step #2</a> is just to copy in some code files (about 50 files)</li><li>We'll copy these files from a Google made project called GTL</li><li>Google made this code before ARC was around so you need to tell the compiler -fno-objc-arc</li><li>These 50 files are the exact some regardless of what Endpoints backend you are talking to.</li></ul>"

1,Endpoints iOS Client,5,Service Object,yes,Questions,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mtXjdQFCFIMwvv3Fc15JcF599t0s425ghkKx4XeMPag/edit?usp=sharing,1h0y4YFyttI,"<ul><li>The first step in using the generated client code is to make a service object.</li><li>In this case the class name for the service object is GTLServiceMoviequotes since it is a service specifically generated for the Moviequotes API</li><li>Your service object has a variable called rpcUrl.  Change the rpcUrl and the service object will talk to a different backend (for example deployed or localhost)</li></ul>"

It uses a GET request to return a JSON list of Moviequotes.</li><li>All Endpoints methods follow the same format:<ul><li>Make a query object</li><li>Use the service object to execute the query</li><li>Use a callback block to handle the response</li></ul></li><li>When the response comes back (think about it, it goes to like Atlanta and back in 2 seconds) use the data to populate the list.</li></ul><script src='https://gist.github.com/fisherds/f78046a14b904870e3c8.js'></script>"

(there are also ways to remove data via POST as well, but on the backend we chose DELETE instead).</li><li>Our implementation will delete the quote immediately on the client, so no action is needed after the response comes back.</li></ul><script src='https://gist.github.com/fisherds/11c237ecc4480459c4e2.js'></script>"
